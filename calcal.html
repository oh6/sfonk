<h1> Calcal </h1>

<p>
Calcal tracks calories and a selection of other food categories,
and tracks items on hand, container weights, and prepared
recipes.
</p>

<h2> Options </h2>

<p>
The <code>-s</code> option puts <code>calcal</code> into
"summarize" mode, where all lines from the input are appended to
<code>~/.calcal.log</code>, any lines recording eating anything are
rolled up into a single <code>overflow</code> item, and the items
on hand, new prepared recipes, container weights, and other entries
are copied to the output, with the current date in a comment at the
top.
</p>

<p>
I record whatever I'm eating for the day in a file, and the next
day run the file through <code>calcal -s</code> in the editor to
bring it up to date.  Note that if a file is summarized multiple
times without replacing the contents this way, it will get recorded
multiple times.
</p>

<p>
The <code>-c</code> option does a simple clean-up operation on
the log, to deal with the multiple entries mentioned above.  Exact
duplicates are removed, logs with the same date are compared and I
get prompted as to whether to remove the later one or edit it.
</p>

<h1> Input Format </h1>

<h2> General </h2>

<p>
Entries are one per line.  Any entry may have a comment,
introduced by <code>#</code> and continuing until the end of the
line.
</p>

<p>
A comment of the form <code># YYYY/MM/DD</code> is taken to be
the day's date, and is used to avoid using recorded weights in
<code>~/.calcal.log</code> for the current day.
</p>

<p>
On startup, <code>calcal</code> reads the entries in
<code>~/.calories</code>, which can be used to keep general nutritional
information, unit conversions, and equivalents.
</p>

<h2> Nutritional information </h2>

<p>
<em>name</em> <code>:</code> <em>calories</em>[<code>VF</code>] [
<em>amount</em><code>V</code> ] [ <em>amount</em><code>F</code> ]
/ <em>quantity</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Name</em> may contain spaces.
</p>

<p>
<em>Calories</em> is just a number.  Feel free to use calories,
kilocalories, kilojoules, or whatever's easiest.  Note that this
can be negative, for use when recording exercise or the special
<code>day</code> and <code>overflow</code> items (see below.)
</p>

<p>
<em>Quantity</em> may have a unit, which must be right next to
the number with no white space between them.
</p>

<p>
The <code>V</code> and <code>F</code> amounts are optional
attributes.  I added them to keep track of stuff that my dietician
considers vegetables and fruit.  As a convenience, I can put the
<code>V</code> or <code>F</code> immediately after the calorie
amount (no spaces) and <em>quantity</em> (after conversion, see
below) will be recorded as the amount for that attribute.
</p>

<p>
Special items:
</p>

<p>
The special item <code>day</code> determines my daily calorie
intake target.  This is meant to be a negative number.  The way I
use it, I end my daily log with <code>1 day</code>, and use
<code>calcal -s</code> to roll it over when I start the next day's
log.
</p>

<p>
The special item <code>overflow</code> is used to roll over
calorie amounts from one day to the next.
</p>


<h2> Unit Conversion </h2>

<p>
<em>unit</em> = <em>amount</em>
</p>

<p>
The special unit <code>DELTA</code> (all upper case) is used
to suggest a calorie target for the day when I've gone way
overboard.
</p>

<p>
Use whatever units you prefer; just make sure to be consistent.
</p>

<h2> Equivalents </h2>

<p>
<em>quantity</em> <em>name</em> <code>~</code> <em>equivalent</em>
</p>

<p>
I originally added this to facilitate conversions between weights
and volumes for recipes.  Make sure that <em>quantity</em> includes
a unit!
</p>

<h2> Eaten items </h2>

<p>
<em>quantity</em>[<code>+-</code>] <em>item</em>[<code>+-</code>]
[ <code>@</code> <em>nutritional info.</em> ]
</p>

<p>
The big one!  Most of my time is spent fretting over these.
</p>

<p>
If <em>quantity</em> ends with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>,
this is used to update the items on hand, and has
no effect on recorded calorie intake.  Items on hand are preserved
when summarizing, so I can do something like:
</p>

<p>
<code>honey+ 1000</code>
</p>

<p>
to record that I got in a 1-kilogram container of honey.  Later
ordinary items will subtract from this value, bottoming out when
it hits zero.  There ought to be a warning if that happens, but
there isn't.
</p>

<p>
I use this to catch any errors in recording.
If I've used up a container but there's still something left
in the items on hand, I forgot to record something.
</p>

<p>
<em>Item</em> is a name from the nutritional database, and can
contain spaces.  If it ends with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>,
this is taken to be a container weighing.  Suppose I have two
entries like this:
</p>

<pre>
980	ketchup+
900	ketchup-
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-</code> entry is subtracted from the <code>+</code>
entry and is used as the amount.  Container weights are recorded
in the summary, so for later uses I can omit the <code>+</code>
entry.
</p>

<p>
<em>Quantity</em> can't end with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>
if <em>item</em> ends with <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>.  This
ought to be an error, but it isn't yet.
</p>

<p>
If a container weight was given previously, any entry without
a container weight for that item won't update the items on hand.
This way I can adjust for losses in preparation or re-use nutritional
information for something I ate that didn't come out of my items
on hand.
</p>

<p>
For one-off entries or when I don't want to use the nutritional
database, I can add the nutritional information in-line, separating
it from <em>item</em> with <code>@</code>:
</p>

<pre>
290 soy milk @ 90/250
</pre>

<p>
This doesn't work with container weights, sorry!
</p>

<h2> Prepared Recipes </h2>

<p>
<em>name</em> <code>/</code> <em>servings</em> <code>{</code>
</p>

<p>
[...]
</p>

<p>
<code>}</code>
</p>

<p>
Entries between the braces are taken to be part of some recipe,
and after sumarizing it shows up as a single item.
</p>

<pre>
pancakes/4 {
    188 flour
    38  sugar
    45	oil
    400 soy milk
}
</pre>

<p>
turns into
</p>

<p>
<code>pancakes:</code> <em>calories</em><code>/</code>4
</p>

<p>
after summarizing.  I suppose it might also make sense to add this to the
items on hand, but I haven't implemented it yet.
</p>

<h1> Example </h1>

<p>
Suppose this was my current "day card":
</p>

<pre>
# 2020/05/18
day:            -2300/1
horseradish:    18/14           # bubbies
chocolate:      200/40          # nn dark
soy milk:       90/250          # silk unsweetened
apricot jam:    1666/671
oatmeal:        1793/4
boksf:          2608 761V/4

51+     honey
449+    apricot jam
1727+   soy milk
472+	olive oil

1058    olive oil+
693	ketchup+

1725    overflow
51      honey
1       oatmeal
1       boksf
26      brown sugar
3.3     walking
550     potato
1027    olive oil-
-15     olive oil
550     ketchup-
1       day
</pre>

<p>
Notes:
</p>

<p>
<code>boksf</code> is my abbreviation for bok choy stir-fry.
</p>

<p>
The <code>-15 olive oil</code> entry is there to compensate for
how much oil got left on the pan (I was making oven fries) and in
the mixing bowl.
</p>

<p>
Running this through <code>calcal</code>:
</p>

<pre>
  1725.0   1725.0      1.0 overflow
   155.1     51.0      3.0 honey (by weight)
   448.2      1.0    448.2 oatmeal
   652.0      1.0    652.0 boksf
    98.0     26.0      3.8 brown sugar
  -168.3      3.3    -51.0 walking
   423.3    550.0      0.8 potato
   274.0     31.0      8.8 olive oil
  -132.6    -15.0      8.8 olive oil
   130.0    143.0      0.9 ketchup (by weight)
 -2300.0      1.0  -2300.0 day (190 veg) (net 1305 target 1225 offset 80)
1305
</pre>

<p>
I'm still getting back on track after overdoing it the day
before yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Here's what the day card looks like after rolling it over with
<code>calcal -s</code>:
</p>

<pre>
# 2020/06/01
day:            -2300/1
horseradish:    18/14           # bubbies
chocolate:      200/40          # nn dark
soy milk:       90/250          # silk unsweetened
apricot jam:    1666/671
oatmeal:        1793/4
boksf:          2608 761V/4

0+      honey
449+    apricot jam
1727+   soy milk
441+    olive oil

1027    olive oil+
550     ketchup+

1305    overflow # target: 1225
</pre>

<p>
The <code># target: 1225</code> is a magic comment that
<code>calcal</code> uses to keep track of how I'm doing getting
back on track.
